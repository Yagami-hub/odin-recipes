        <p>
            Learn how to make French <strong>fries that are super crispy with this twice-fried method.</strong> I don't think most people realize that any decent French fry needs to be fried twice. 
            <br> The first frying is done at a lower temperature, which softens the potato and prepares the starchy surface for the second frying's crispification.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 1</strong>
                <p>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 2</strong>
                <p>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. 
                <br>Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 3</strong>
                <p>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 4</strong>
                <p>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</p>
