# odin-recipes

Itâ€™s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge i have acquired to this time. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Building this project i will use skills, such as: text formating, creating lists, links and images.
